## Disabling User Accounts

Kafka does not support disabling user accounts.

## Password Policies 

* Passwords must be at least 8 characters long. This ensures a basic level of complexity and security.
* The passwords can contain only the following symbols:
    * Alphabets: a-zA-Z
    * Numerals: 0-9
    * Punctuation marks: ., ;, !, ?
    * Mathematical symbols: -, +, *, /, %
    * Brackets: (, ), {, }, <, >
    * Additional symbols: _, |, &, @, $, ^, #, ~

**Note**: To ensure that passwords are sufficiently complex, it is recommended to include:

* A minimum length of 8 characters
* At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
* At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
* At least one numeral (0-9)
* At least one special character from the allowed symbols list

## Changing password guide

Kafka Service supports the automatic password change procedure.
Any credential in the `global.secrets.kafka` section can be changed and run with upgrade procedure.
Operator performs necessary logic to apply new credentials to Kafka, AKHQ and Backup Daemon pods.

**Note:** It requires full cluster restart.

The manual password changing procedures for Kafka Service is described in respective guide:

* [Password changing guide](/docs/public/password-changing.md)

# Logging

Security events and critical operations should be logged for audit purposes.
You can find more details about available audit logging in [Audit Guide](/docs/public/audit.md).
